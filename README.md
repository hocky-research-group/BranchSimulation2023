### Yuvraj Singh, Brad J. Nolen, Glen M. Hocky
**This repository will include the in the GROMACS input files to run production MD and a Jupyter Notebook (Arp23_analysis.ipynb) to run relevant analysis on sample trajectories and topology files provided. The repository consists of the following directories**

1) **7TPT**; Branch junction pdb
2) **BtArp23_splay**; Inactive Arp2/3 complex pdb
3) **full_junction**; Full branch junction sample trajectory files and input files
4) **just_complex**; Active Arp2/3 complex sample trajectory files and input files
5) **morph**; Snapshots of 31 cryo-em structures of Arp2/3 complex transitioning from the splayed configuration to shortpitch configuration
6) **no_daughter**; Active Arp2/3 complex (bound to mother filament only) sample trajectory files and input files
7) **splayed**; Inactive Arp2/3 complex sample trajectory files and input files
